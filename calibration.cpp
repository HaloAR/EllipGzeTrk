IPD from gaze triangle;

angle between gaze vectors (normals to pupils) known,

distance between eye cameras and their angles known


1 find gaze vectors in both a left and right direction

2 find their intersections at middle of eyeball

z=0 to z@intersection is eyeball radius

distance from ellipse centres correccted by eyeball centres compared to known camera spacing gives IPD

distance from eye to display



[main ellipse]


find shortest distance in skew lines
point at half of shortest distance is centre of rotation
